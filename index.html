<header>About This Page . . .
</header>
<body>
<p>My name is Doug Schiano and I have been working in software development for the last 18 years. I love computers, software and creating things with my hands. 

This is page is experimental. It has been a while since I have created a webpage so I plan to use this page to experiment with some of the new services and tools out there. I will also post articles I write on topics I find interesting.
</p>
<p>Here are a couple of topics I have already written about</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="hr_articles.html" alt="HR Hiring Process">HR Hiring Process</a></li>
<li><a href="devops_articles.html" alt="DevOps">DevOps</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I plan on adding blog posts about random things on my mind and on topics that interest me.
</p>
<p>You may have noticed how simple this webpage is at the moment. That is because I am writing these pages by hand, using the most basic HTML tags. I will add styling or a framework later. I just wanted to get something up and running quickly.
</p>
<p>I wrote up the process which I used to date to create this website. You can find the process <a href="create.html" alt="Creating an AWS website.">here</a>.
